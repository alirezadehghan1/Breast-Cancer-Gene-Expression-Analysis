# Breast-Cancer-Gene-Expression-Analysis

This project conducts an exploratory data analysis on the METABRIC breast cancer gene expression dataset from Kaggle. The primary goal is to gain insights and understanding from the dataset, especially regarding clinical information and its relationship with breast cancer survival. The analysis focuses on investigating the relationships between clinical features like age, tumor size, and survival time with gene expression and mutation data related to breast cancer patients. 
After loading the data into Pandas, visualizations and comparisons are generated to understand distributions and trends in the features. Preprocessing steps like handling missing data and creating dummy variables are also performed to prepare the data for future modeling and analysis. Overall, this initial investigation and preparation provides a foundation for further machine learning and bioinformatics work with the gene expression profiles.
This analysis provides an initial understanding of the dataset, and prepares the data for further predictive modeling or in-depth research.
